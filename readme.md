# ToDo List

Just a simple todo list.
I enjoyed pretty much everything about this project. :) 

You can check the demo [here](https://todoappbydabgan.netlify.app/).

## What technologies did I use?

In this project I used **only** HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## What did I learn?

 - a lot of things about DOM i.e. how to dynamically add/delete elements, classes or attach events
 - how to store data in localStorage in JavaScript
 - how to use this stored data
 - SCSS syntax and variables
 - what is JS Date object and how to use it
 - drag & drop events using Vanilla JS
